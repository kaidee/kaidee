Before I begin, I need to thank a few people. I’m talking to you, gen-
tlemen: Joe Armstrong, Satoshi Asakawa, Paul Barry, Emmanuel Ber-
nard, Roberto Bettazzoni, Ola Bini, Piergiuliano Bossi, Simone Busoli,
Andrea Cisternino, Davide D’Alto, Mauro Di Nuzzo, Marco Di Timo-
teo, Mauricio Fernandez, Jay Fields, Michele Finelli, Neal Ford, Flo-
rian Frank, Sanne Grinovero, Federico Gobbo, Florian Groß, Sebastian
Hennebrüder, Doug Hudson, Jurek Husakowski, Lyle Johnson, Luca
Marchetti, MenTaLguY, Carlo Pecchia, Andrea Provaglio, Mike Roberts,
Martin Rodgers, Jeremy Sydik, Andrea Tomasini, Marco Trincardi, Ivan
Vaghi, Giancarlo Valente, Davide Varvello, Jim Weirich, and the dozens
of readers who reported problems and errata while this book was in
beta. Whether you provided reviews, quotes, fixes, opinions, or moral
support, there’s at least one line in this book that changed for the bet-
ter because of you. Did I say one line? For some of you, make that “a
few chapters.” In particular, Ola, Satoshi, and Jurek deserve a special
place on this page and my enduring gratitude.
Thanks to the staff at the Pragmatic Bookshelf: Janet Furlow, Seth
Maislin, Steve Peter, Susannah Davidson Pfalzer, and Kim Wimpsett.
Dave and Andy, thank you for believing in this project when times got
rough. Jill, thank you for making my awkward prose look so effortless.
Our crunch week in Venice was a lot of hard work, but it was definitely
worth it. And speaking of Venice: thank you, Lucio, for being such a
dear old friend.
Mom and Dad, thank you for your support, for your love, and for never
asking why I was taking so long to finish this book.
Most authors’ closing thanks go to their partners, and now I know why.
When you’re about to finish a book, you turn back to the day when
you started writing, and it feels so far away. I remember writing over
lunch breaks, nights, and weekends, locked for days or weeks inside
